# COVID-19_Data_Analytics
Welcome to the **COVID-19 Analytics Dashboard**, an interactive data analysis project that tracks and visualizes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic globally and in India. This project uses a variety of data analytics techniques to generate insights, visualize trends, and forecast future cases, helping you better understand the pandemic's trajectory.


## Features

- **Real-Time Data**: Displays the latest COVID-19 statistics, including confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases.
- **Trends Over Time**: Visualizes the trends of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths over time, specifically for India.
- **Mortality Rate Analysis**: Tracks the mortality rate, providing insights into how the situation has evolved.
- **Doubling Rate**: Calculates the doubling rate of cases to predict how quickly the disease spreads.
- **Forecasting**: Uses the ARIMA model to forecast future confirmed cases based on historical data.
- **Vaccination Coverage**: Visualizes vaccination coverage across Indian states, showing the percentage of the population vaccinated.
